            <p>
              This data-driven visualization metaphorically represents a necklace rolling through Pacific Ocean waves,
              aiming to bind Pacific nations toward a shared future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by the dataset's complexity, the guiding principle is to maintain a comprehensive, expansive
              perspective. This tool has therefore been designed to capture a broad landscape view — like a sailor
              keeping
              the broad horizon ahead.

            <h3 id="purpose-heading">Why dataWave?</h3>
            <p>
              A complex development indicator database needs an <em>investigation kickstarter</em>. Before rushing into
              a
              feature-rich dataset, obtaining a synthetic overview is invaluable. This <em>waveplot</em> allows you to
              visualize global trends across countries, subregions, per year and key thematic areas without hassle. When
              you
              detect an intriguing <em>angle</em>, you can then cross-reference your hypothesis with the original
              tabular
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              The visualization doesn't just tell one story — it reveals multiple narratives through its data "pearls".
              Here are two examples.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section aria-labelledby="balanced-heading">
            <h3 id="balanced-heading">What is the most balanced thematic area?</h3>
            <p>
              On the global scale, the climate change and disasters domain (5) emerges as remarkably uniform.
            </p>
            <p>
              New Caledonia leads slightly, but other nations follow closely. Most states demonstrate <em>some</em>
              renewable energy production, and disaster reporting is probably consistent across countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this macro-level analysis conceals complexities. If you check the tabular dataset you will find
              out
              that while an overall balance exists, renewable energy contributions vary. Nations tend to specialize in
              specific renewable types, creating a global ecosystem of <strong>complementary energy strategies</strong>.
            </p>

          <section aria-labelledby="diverging-heading">
            <h3 id="diverging-heading">What is the most diverging thematic area?</h3>
            <p>
              People-Centered Development (2022) offers a particularly striking example.
            </p>
            <p>
              Polynesia dominates, with 4 out of 5 shown states ranking in the top-4. This isn't merely a ranking
              phenomenon. Closer examination reveals that most Polynesian states not only perform quite well but also
              demonstrate
              higher reporting consistency in this area. In contrast, other regions exhibit higher missing data rates.
            </p>
            <p class="centered-em">Now, the question is: what story will you uncover?</p>

            <h4 id="tech-notes-heading">Technical notes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The application is mobile-responsive but offers the most comfortable experience on wider screens.</li>
              <li>Each state is color-coded, with states from the same subregion sharing a consistent color palette,
                enabling intuitive regional identification.</li>
              <li>A unified score has been computed for each state across years and thematic areas, providing a
                synthesized
                perspective. While offering a valuable overview, this score is a lens, not the entire landscape — always
                refer to the <strong>original Blue Pacific dataset</strong> for detailed insights.</li>
              <li>The demo currently supports data from two years with sufficient data coverage: 2022 and 2023.</li>
              <li>Tooltip-displayed missing data serves as a reliability indicator for the unified score. Be cautious
                with
                scores from countries showing high missing data rates. Indicators with sparse country coverage were
                systematically filtered out.</li>
            </ul>
